ѕопытка 5
мо€ таблица. добавили next action/. врем€ между действи€ми. убрали первое значение. в общем, подготовили дл€ следующего анализа: по идее надо оставить только щначени€ по кра€м. и дальше с ними работать

SELECT 
    `test-devim.data.action`.client_id as client_id,
    `test-devim.data.action`.action_type as action_type,
    `test-devim.data.action`.created_at as created_at,
    LEAD(`test-devim.data.action`.created_at) OVER ( 
    ORDER BY `test-devim.data.action`.created_at ASC) AS next_action,
    TIMESTAMP_DIFF(LEAD(`test-devim.data.action`.created_at) OVER ( 
    ORDER BY `test-devim.data.action`.created_at ASC), `test-devim.data.action`.created_at, second) as time_btwn_nxt
FROM
    `test-devim.data.action`
ORDER BY
created_at

дальше иде€ сделать окно размером два и вычитать экшн тайп друг из друга, если там не равно 0, то оставить эти €чейки

»“ј !  тут сделали два ключевых пол€. очистили по времению . теперь две задачи: 
1) удалить в первом поле все значени€, где не ноль
2) во втором удалить везде где ноль

ѕќ„“» ѕќЅ≈ƒј! получили две строки, что нам нужны. надо в таблицу добавить второе действие

—оздадим таблицу со временем второго действи€:

теперь к этой таблице добавим исходную, то есть добавим айди, врем€, тип дестви€ и т.д.
